\title{Create an interactive Shiny app for visualization & exploration of MAGeCK RRA CRISPR analyses}
\usage{
shinyMAGeCK(
  gene.data,
  sgrna.data,
  count.summary,
  norm.counts,
  h.id = "mag1",
  use.depmap.essential = TRUE,
  essential.genes = NULL,
  depmap.data = NULL,
  genesets = NULL,
  return.app = TRUE,
  height = 800
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene.data}{A named list containing \code{gene_summary.txt} tables as data.frames. Multiple data.frames may be provided, one per element of the list.
Users will be able to swap between them within the app. List element names should match names of \code{grna.data} list elements.}

\item{sgrna.data}{A named list containing \code{sgrna_summary.txt} tables as data.frames. Multiple data.frames may be provided, one per element of the list.
Users will be able to swap between them within the app. List element names should match names of \code{gene.data} list elements.}

\item{count.summary}{Matrix or dataframe containing count summary (\code{countsummary.txt}) as generated by \code{mageck count}.}

\item{norm.counts}{Matrix or dataframe containing normalized counts (\code{count_normalized.txt}) as generated by \code{mageck count}.}

\item{h.id}{String indicating unique ID for interactive plots.
Required if multiple apps are run within the same Rmd file.}

\item{use.depmap.essential}{Boolean indicating whether to download and use DepMap CRISPR and RNAi gene dependency summaries for selective and common essential labeling.}

\item{essential.genes}{Optional character vector of gene identifiers of common essential genes (i.e. pan-lethal) that can be used for labeling/filtering plots.
If provided, overrides the depmap essential genes.}

\item{depmap.data}{Optional named list containing depmap data.}

\item{genesets}{Optional named list containing genesets that can be interactively highlighted on the plots.
The elements of the list should each be a geneset with gene identifiers matching those used in the results.}

\item{return.app}{Optional boolean indicating whether a Shiny app should be returned. \code{TRUE} by default. If \code{FALSE},
a named list of app elements (ui and server) will be returned instead. Useful for deploying as a standalone shiny app.}

\item{height}{Number indicating height of app in pixels.}
}
\value{
A Shiny app containing interactive visualizations of MAGeCK RRA analysis results.
}
\description{
This shiny app is composed of multiple tabs to peruse RRA results and compare them between timepoints or samples.
Also included are numerous QC plots. Almost all plots are interactive and their aesthetics can be easily tweaked
using the sidebar. See the Details section for more information.
}
\details{
Gene labels can be added to the MAplot and volcano plot by clicking a point. The labels can also be dragged around,
though adding labels will reset the positions, so it's recommended to add all labels prior to re-positioning them.

Features with no variation will be removed prior to \code{\link[PCAtools]{pca}} being run for the PCA visualization.
